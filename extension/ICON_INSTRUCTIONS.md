# Icon Instructions

The extension requires PNG icon files. Currently, placeholder files are in place.

## Required Icons

You need to create three PNG icon files:
- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels  
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

## How to Create Icons

1. **Design your icon** (recommended: 128x128 or larger)
2. **Use an icon generator**:
   - Online: https://www.favicon-generator.org/
   - Online: https://convertio.co/svg-png/
   - Or use image editing software like Photoshop, GIMP, or Figma

3. **Resize to required sizes**:
   - 16x16 pixels for `icon16.png`
   - 48x48 pixels for `icon48.png`
   - 128x128 pixels for `icon128.png`

4. **Save as PNG** files in the `extension/icons/` folder

## Quick Solution

You can use the Rtrvr logo or any purple/blue gradient icon with the letter "R" or a robot/AI symbol.

For now, the extension will work without proper icons, but they will appear as broken images in the browser.
